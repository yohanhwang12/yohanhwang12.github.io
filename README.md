## Description

Several years ago, an Android version of the game was featured by Amplify Tablets, then an educational company that made tablets for use in schools.
In the game students have to make decisions as to where to allocate their money, be it in the stock market, the bank or under their mattress.
Of course the game is a simulation of the Great Depression so after an exhilarating times in the markets, they experience a stock rout
and even a bank run.

The resume features a navbar, carousel, accordion and a form. The game features sound effects, animations, and range sliders that interact with each other
for user validation.
