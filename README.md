index.html is an online interactive resume which showcases my skills in using html, css, javascript and bootstrap. 
It features a navbar, carousel and an accordion among other items. The page is responsive to adjust to mobile devices
as the width of the viewport shrinks.

The carousel contains my portfolio which features my work in various areas. There is a coding, writing and teaching portfolio provided on the links.
For the coding part, the link leads to a game I originally created as a teacher, named Great Depression Simulation.

Several years ago, an Android version of the game was featured by Amplify Tablets, then an educational company that made tablets for use in schools.
In the game students have to make decisions as to where to allocate their money, be it in the stock market, the bank or under their mattress.
Of course the game is a simulation of the Great Depression so after an exhilarating times in the markets, they experience a stock rout
and even a bank run.

The game was created using html, css, javascript and vue. It features sound effects, animations, and range sliders that interact with each other
for user validation.
